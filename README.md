# Commmunity Job Boards available

 - [FrontEndBR Vagas - Brazilian FrontEnd Community Job Board ](https://github.com/frontendbr/vagas)

-----

Add a job in a job board is bad, apply for them is worse.

There is a lot of websites fighting for a job post and user registration. Companies must register in a lot of websites (some of them are paid), all of it is very frustrating.

The frustration occurs for those who apply for these jobs either. Candidates must complete a huge form with all the information that's already in its curriculum:\\, just to upload its curriculum and write a summary of its life, copied from curriculum...

# Community Job Board Initiative

The **Community Job Board Initiative** started when some [brazilian developers were discussing about](https://github.com/frontendbr/forum/issues/15) how all of it is boring and were trying to find a [KISS](https://people.apache.org/~fhanik/kiss.html) solution.

# KISS

- [x] No dedicated website
- [x] Any company can add a job entirely free using a github account
- [x] Any community can create a repository entirely free using a github account
- [x] Jobs can be closed, as any github issue
- [x] Job boards are accessible at **https://github.com/[community_name]/[repo_name]/issues/**

## Generators

Want to create a generator using this initiative? Share with us.
A **website app** using __nodejs__, __ruby__ or any other language that reads github issues in a repo using [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/) to generate a custom web site will be amazing, isn't it?
